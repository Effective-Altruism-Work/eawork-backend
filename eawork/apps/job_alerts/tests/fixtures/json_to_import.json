They have offices in countries with high levels of malnutrition: Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Tanzania.

They run rescue, rehabilitation, and rehoming programs, as well as investigations, prosecutions, and campaigns aimed to raise the standards affecting wild and farm animals, pets, and animals used in research and testing. Their work focused on farm animals is carried out by livestock welfare specialists who take a number of different approaches towards improving the lives of as many farm animals as possible. They develop welfare standards and certification programs, commission research, and work with and positively influence stakeholders such as food and farming industry decision-makers, smallholders, and scientists and veterinarians. The RSPCA also has representatives on several influential government, farming industry, and scientific research project committees, and is consulted on farm animal welfare issues by a range of national and international government bodies and organisations.",

Questions of interest range from the theoretical to the applied, for example how to conceptualize, measure and evaluate health inequalities or disease severity; how to prioritize resources between disease areas, rural and urban patients, and age cohorts or generations; the acceptability of paternalistic health promotion measures; and many others.\n\nOur approach emphasizes collaboration and interdisciplinarity, and seeks to inform and be informed by other fields of inquiry such as general ethics and philosophy, health policy, and health economics. We welcome innovative questions and methods and ambitious thinking, and value clear presentation of ideas.",

On an annual basis, they recommend a short list of top charities in global health and development which they believe can save or improve the greatest number of lives per dollar donated. They extensively research each charity before recommending it, continue its evaluation every year, and publish the full details of their analyses so donors can fully vet their reasoning. GiveWell focuses on what additional funding can accomplish, seeking to understand what activities marginal donations would enable that a charity wouldn't be able to do otherwise. They approach charities from a skeptical point of view, looking for independent evidence of effectiveness that is highly specific, representative, and credible.\n<br><br>\nMore than 50,000 donors have trusted GiveWell to direct their donations, and together, they have given over $500 million to their recommended organizations. These donations will help save over 75,000 lives and provide cash grants of over $90 million to the global poor. GiveWell is independently supported by donors who give directly to their operations. They don\u2019t take fees from donations directed to the charities they recommend nor receive fees from charities for featuring them on their site.\n<br><br>\n<em>Disclaimer: 80,000 Hours has received a grant from the Open Philanthropy Project, which works closely with GiveWell.<\/em>",

Their methodology is to break down the alignment problem into simpler and more precisely stated subproblems, develop basic mathematical theory for understanding these problems, and then make use of the newfound understanding in engineering applications.
